# Positive-edge-triggered-D-Flip-Flop-using-Clocked-Mos-Logic

Positive Edge triggered D Flip Flop using Clocked MOS
logic (Dynamic) This circuit has a great advantage over
the conventional CMOS or Pass Transistor. We have used
a Two-phase clock that is nonoverlapping routing delay
would not cause clock skew. The implemented logic function
or the logic gate is achieved through 2 modes of operation:
Precharge and Evaluate. This circuit a ratio-less circuit.
This circuit faster-switching speed because of a lower
load capacitance of 0. 0001uf.In total 14 transistors are used
and I have set the internal complemented clock. The problem
of clock slew and race around condition is now solved
the only disadvantage of this circuit is the dependence on
the complemented clock.
